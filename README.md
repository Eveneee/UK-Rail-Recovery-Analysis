The Recovery Paradox: An Analysis of Demand and Reliability in UK Passenger Rail (2015-2024)

Project Overview
This project analyses the operational health of the UK railway network in the post-pandemic era. By integrating data from the Office of Rail and Road (ORR), it juxtaposes the successful recovery of passenger demand against the systemic deterioration of service reliability. This work was produced for the IJC445 Data Science coursework.

Research Question
The Recovery Paradox: An Analysis of Demand and Reliability in UK Passenger Rail


Key Messages & Findings
Demand is Back (Panel A): Passenger journeys have shown remarkable resilience, rebounding to 99.4% of pre-pandemic levels by 2024.
Reliability is Broken (Panel B): Despite the return of passengers, major operators (Avanti, GWR, LNER, Northern) show a synchronized, secular decline in punctuality starting from 2021.
The Quality Trade-off (Panel C): There is a strong negative correlation between punctuality and cancellation rates, suggesting that operational stress is leading to systemic service failures.
Uneven Impact (Panel D): The crisis is not evenly distributed; specific operators like Avanti West Coast and CrossCountry exhibit significantly higher cancellation rates compared to the industry average.
